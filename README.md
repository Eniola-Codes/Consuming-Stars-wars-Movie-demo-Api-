**Technologies**

Technologies i used to build this are React.js, css and the starwars API

I used React.js framework to bootstrap this project because of the below functionalities : 

- Seperation of concerns (Having leaner files and components by breaking down the code into smaller parts)
- Prop drilling to pass some data from component to component with ease.
- Css modules which prevent clashing of classnames around components therefore avoiding unwanted results

# Installation and Running

git clone or pull the project using your terminal, open the project folder on your local laptop in a code editor and run "npm start" in your editors terminal.
